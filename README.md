# Note Taker Starter Code

# Description

This is a note-taking app I've written the backend code for, deployed with Heroku. It allows the user to save and delete notes that they've written.

# Credits

The backend was written by me, Kyle Oros, with the assistance of an edX bootcamp tutor and an AskBCS learning assistant. I used the instructional resources from the UCI bootcamp to help guide me in writing.
